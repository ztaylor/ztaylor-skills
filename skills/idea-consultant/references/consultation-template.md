# [Area Name]: Expert Consultation

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs that a busy executive could read to understand your key recommendations. Be specific—not "consider your options" but "use Stripe for payments because X, Y, Z."]

Example tone:

> For your astronomy subscription box, I recommend starting with Cratejoy as your subscription platform despite their 1.25% + $0.10 transaction fee. The built-in subscriber management, dunning, and marketplace exposure justify the cost for a bootstrapped launch. Once you exceed 500 subscribers, migrate to a custom Shopify + Recharge setup for better margins and flexibility.

## Context Analysis

[Market landscape relevant to this specific area. What's happening in this space? What timing factors matter? What do competitors do?]

This section should demonstrate you understand the broader context, not just the user's immediate situation.

## Your Situation

[How their specific constraints affect recommendations. Reference their budget, experience, timeline, and risk tolerance from discovery.]

Example:

> With your $15K budget and 6-month timeline, you can't afford custom packaging from day one. Start with kraft mailers and branded stickers, then upgrade to custom boxes after month 6 if retention metrics justify the investment.

## Recommendations

Structure each recommendation clearly:

### [Topic Name]

**Recommendation:** [The specific choice you're recommending]

**Rationale:** [Why this is the right choice for their situation—not generic reasons, but specific to their constraints]

**Estimated Cost:** [Be specific: "$200-400 one-time" or "$50/month" or "15-20% of revenue"]

**Action Step:** [The literal next thing they should do: "Email hello@example.com requesting a quote for 500 units"]

**Alternatives considered:** [Optional—when useful, mention what you didn't recommend and why]

Repeat for each topic within this area. Typically 5-15 recommendations per document.

## Budget Allocation

| Item                    | One-Time Cost | Monthly Cost | Notes                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Platform subscription   | -             | $39-79       | Cratejoy Pro plan          |
| Initial inventory       | $2,000-3,000  | -            | First 3 months of products |
| Packaging supplies      | $500          | $200         | Mailers, inserts, tape     |
| ...                     | ...           | ...          | ...                        |
| **Total for this area** | **$X**        | **$X/mo**    |                            |

Note: These should sum correctly across all consultation documents to match the user's stated budget range.
